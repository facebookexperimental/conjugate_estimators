# The conjugate beta estimator statistical algorithm


## Introduction
This repo contains a reference implementation for a statistical algorithm called
Conjugate Beta Estimator (CBE) for computing
CIs for population means using (weighted) sample means and
potentially noisy labels.

## Basic algorithm
The basic formula for CBE is

    alpha = mu*n + alpha_prior
    beta = (1-mu)*n + beta_prior
    ci = [ppf(0.05, alpha, beta), ppf(0.95, alpha, beta)

where mu is the mean of the (weighted) sample labels and n is the sample size in bits

## Accounting for label noise
Both mu and n can be adjusted to account for label noise.

mu should be adjusted using the [Rogan Gladen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Gladen) (RG) estimator for the sample mean:

    mu_modified = (mu + specificity - 1) / (sensitivity + specificity - 1)

n should be adjusted using the following formula:

    num_bits_per_label = (1 - entropy((sensitivity + specificity) / 2))
    n_modified = num_bits_per_label * n

the accuracy adjusted CBE formula is therefore

    alpha_modified = mu_modified*n_modified + alpha_prior
    beta_modified = (1-mu_modified)*n_modified + beta_prior
    ci = [ppf(0.05, alpha_modified, beta_modified), ppf(0.95, alpha_modified, beta_modified)

The reason for the num_bits_per_label formula is that the rg formula is increasingly unstable when
the mean of sensitivity and specificity approaches 0.5 (the max entropy value) and the
rg denominator approaches 0. The rg formula
is maximally stable when sensitivity = specificity = 1, which is the case when labels are perfectly
accurate. Therefore, we want the CI derived from the Beta distribution to grow wider as
(sensitivity + specificity)/2 approaches 0.5 from 0 or 1.

The relationship between average accuracy and # of bits per label is visualized in the graph below.

## Mathematical derivation

The following formula shows that the 1-H(X) formula, where H() is entropy and X is a label's probability
of containing an accurate label, can be expressed as the Bayesian information gain, or KL divergence
between the posterior P and uniform prior Q:

$$D_{\text{KL}}(P \parallel Q) = p * \log_2\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) + (1-p) *\log_2\left(\frac{1-p}{1-q}\right) =$$
$$p *\log_2\left(\frac{p}{0.5}\right) + (1-p) * \log_2\left(\frac{1-p}{0.5}\right) =$$
$$p *\left(\log_2(p) - \log_2(0.5)\right) + (1-p) * \left(\log_2(1-p) - \log_2(0.5)\right) =$$
$$p *\log_2(p) + p + (1-p) *\log_2(1-p) + (1-p) =$$
$$p *\log_2(p) + (1-p) * \log_2(1-p) + 1 = $$
$$ 1 - H(X) $$

To derive a label's probability X the content being positive using the labels TPR
$p(b|a)$ and FPR $p(b|\neg a)$, we can plug them into Bayes's rule and simplify, again using the uniform prior assumption.

$$X = p(a|b) = \frac{p(b|a)*p(a)}{p(b)} = $$
$$\frac{p(b|a)*p(a)}{p(b|a)*p(a) + p(b|\neg a)*p(\neg a)} = $$
$$\frac{p(b|a)*0.5}{p(b|a)*0.5 + p(b|\neg a)*0.5} =$$
$$\frac{p(b|a)}{p(b|a) + p(b|\neg a)}$$
